Two Eclipse plug-ins which provide editors for CSS3 and Less (http://lesscss.org/).

Requirements (i.e., developed on, not tested on anything else):
 - Eclipse 3.7.1
 - Xtext 2.2.1 with ANTLR stuff

The 'latestXtext' branch is only meant to update to the latest version
of Xtext, prior to merging everything to 'master' - in the process
forcing everyone to update to that version of Xtext as well.

You'll find ZIPs with the Eclipse plug-in JARs in the Downloads
section. Drop the JARs into the 'dropins' (or 'plugins', if that
doesn't work) directory in your Eclipse installation directory and
(re-)start your Eclipse. Some of the ZIPs are self-contained, others
aren't. I'm _not_ keeping the ZIPs really up-to-date with HEAD, so to
live on the bleeding edge: clone, import into a suitable Eclipse and
deploy or run the plug-ins yourself.

An p2 update site will be attended to in the future.

Note that these are very much a work-in-progress. I aim to provide
full implementations for CSS3 and Less. Most work is in the CSS part
as Less extends CSS but not by much...  which isn't to say those
extensions aren't really useful - they are! In the end, I also intend
to implement the mapping of Less -> CSS. This is not particularly
difficult, just tedious in the face of all the details of CSS.

Currently, the CSS3 plug-in doesn't really know all that much about
CSS3 beyond some core syntax, so don't expect it to know about
specific HTML elements/types and CSS properties, m'kay? By extension,
the same goes for Less. I hope the syntax checking, highlighting and
minimal validation already provides some convenience.

If you're interested in helping to further develop this, fork at
will. I have some specific ideas on how to go from here, so don't
expect me to always accept a pull request verbatim.  To give an idea,
here's a rough TODO list:

- having more unit tests would be a good idea ;-)
- full compliance with CSS3 lexical scanning
- full implementation of CSS3 validation (e.g., validating RGB literals) - mostly done, methinks
- full implementation of CSS3 property syntax, using single-shot DSL and generation of part of the grammar
- type system implementation for Less
- implementation of Less imports
- nicer syntax highlighting for both CSS and Less
- nice formatting for CSS (and Less)
- evaluation engine for Less (expressions)
- mapping of Less -> CSS (model-2-model transformation)
- builder integration of Less -> CSS, using serialization
