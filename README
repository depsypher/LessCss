Two Eclipse plug-ins which provide editors for CSS3 and Less (http://lesscss.org/).

Requirements (i.e., developed on, not tested on anything else):
 - Eclipse 3.7 (build ID: I20110613-1736)
 - Xtext 2.0.1 (SR1) with ANTLR stuff

Note that these are very much a work-in-progress. I aim to provide full implementations
for CSS3 and Less. Most work is in the CSS part as Less extends CSS but not by much...
which isn't to say those extensions aren't really useful - they are! In the end, I
also intend to implement the mapping of Less -> CSS. This is not particularly difficult,
just tedious in the face of all the details of CSS.

Currently, the CSS3 plug-in doesn't really know all that much about CSS3 beyond some
core syntax, so don't expect it to know about specific HTML elements/types and CSS
properties, m'kay? By extension, the same goes for Less. I hope the syntax checking,
highlighting and minimal validation already provides some convenience.

If you're interested in helping to further develop this, fork at will. I have some specific
ideas on how to go from here, so don't expect me to always accept a pull request.
